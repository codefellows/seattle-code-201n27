# Lecture Notes

* Code Review
  * Gauge the class's experiences from both labs 7 and 8 when planning code review. It may be best to review broken code, or it may be beneficial to build the app again from the ground up, making sure to highlight good code practices and solicit student input.
  * Some common points to reiterate include contextual `this`, naming conventions, organization of code, and general patterns.
* Code Demo
  * Begin with a basic demonstration of event listeners, such as making a `div` with a click event listener in CodePen. Then move on to a demonstration of HTML forms and adding event listeners to the submit button. Make sure to emphasize `preventDefault`, and show examples of both inline callback functions and separately-defined callback functions. It can be helpful to show adding a form as an extension of the previous class's demo code, to show what it looks like to build that form into your existing code base.

    <!-- <h1>The Story in the Book</h1> -->
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying <u>between</u> the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <em>New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote progclaming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secres of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
